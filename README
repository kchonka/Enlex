Enlex is set out to be a web-app flashcard program to assist people in language
learning. Connecting to the Google Translate API, Enlex will be able to create
vocabulary sets in any desired target language. Vocabulary sets can be created
from different categories of words (ex: food, numbers, common verbs, etc.).
The goal is for language learners to be able to expose themselves to new
vocabulary words for free.

Other features will include the ability to track progress and possibly quizzes.
